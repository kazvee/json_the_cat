// Send:
// node index.js Chartreux
// Expected output:
// The Chartreux is generally silent but communicative. Short play sessions, mixed with naps and meals are their perfect day.
// Whilst appreciating any attention you give them, they are not demanding, content instead to follow you around devotedly,
// sleep on your bed and snuggle with you if youâ€™re not feeling well.
